Imagine a solution for faster genome sequencing. Without prior expertise in genome sequencing, we build a case for targeting specific markets and industries, exploring both traditional and new applications for this groundbreaking technology.

## Key Assumptions

- The solution offers identical quality at 100x faster processing speed
- Cost is 10x higher than existing solutions
- Requires a dedicated facility (available as a service or customer-managed)

## Market Applications and Use Cases

The Human Genome Project initiated numerous initiatives in genome mapping, with Celera Corporation's breakthrough disruption. The time may be right for another quantum computing-driven disruption in genomics analytics.
